## The Purpose of the src Folder

The `src` folder is the main folder for source code in many web applications. It contains the following files and subfolders:

- **index.js**: The main entry point for the application, where other modules and files are imported and used to start the server and application.
- **routes.js**: The file that defines the routes and endpoints for the web application, and maps them to specific functions and logic in the controllers and middleware.
- **server.js**: The file that initializes and starts the web server and middleware, and listens for incoming requests from clients.

Subfolders within the `src` folder include:

- **controllers**: Contains JavaScript files that define the behavior and logic of the application, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Controllers are responsible for handling specific actions or requests from clients, and updating the data and views accordingly.
- **db**: Contains files and modules for database management and interaction, such as connection configuration and data models.
- **middleware**: Contains JavaScript files that define middleware functions, which are functions that are executed between the client's request and the server's response. Middleware can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more.
- **utils**: Contains JavaScript files that define utility functions and modules, which are reusable pieces of code that perform common or specific tasks that are used throughout the application.
